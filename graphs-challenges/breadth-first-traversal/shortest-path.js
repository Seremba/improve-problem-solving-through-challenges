/*
shortest path
Write a function, shortestPath, that takes in an array of edges for an
undirected graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). The function should
return the length of the shortest path between A and B. Consider the
length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes.
If there is no path between A and B, then return -1.
