/*
Write a function, zipperLists, that takes in the head of two linked
lists as arguments. The function should zipper the two lists together
into single linked list by alternating nodes. If one of the linked lists
is longer than the other, the resulting list should terminate with the
remaining nodes. The function should return the head of the zippered
linked list.

Do this in-place, by mutating the original Nodes.
You may assume that both input lists are non-empty.
